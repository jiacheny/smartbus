				<p>SmartBus routes undergo 'bus-friendly' roadwork to improve reliability and the way buses move in and out of traffic. Bus lanes are introduced in high-delay locations and in some areas SmartBus buses have the ability to request traffic light priority.</p>
				<p>New technology gives SmartBus buses the ability to communicate with their depot during a journey, and to provide real-time travel information to passengers at selected high-use bus stops. Bus-train interchanges also have signs with real-time information on SmartBus and train arrival times, making journey transitions smoother.</p>
				<p>Bus stops along SmartBus routes are safer and are highly visible, because they have been designed to the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) standards.</p>
				<p>SmartBus stops feature tactile ground surface indicators and high contrast colour schemes that are used to meet the needs of people with a vision impairment. All SmartBus stops provide local area maps and stop specific timetables.</p>
				<p>Low-floor buses are used on SmartBus routes. These buses are able to ‘meet’ the bus stop at the same level and eliminate a ‘step’ to board the bus.</p>
